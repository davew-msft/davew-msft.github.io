Data warehouses (EDWs/DWHs) have their use cases, but they might be stifling your analytics innovations in 2022.  In this session we’ll walk through why the warehouse might not be the best place for your analytics data.  We’ll show you a much simpler alternative that is easier for most Citizen Analysts to understand and will help you on your Self-Service Analytics journey.  Even if you are satisfied with your data warehouse investment, we’ll show you some complementary approaches that may improve your analytics time-to-value.  Finally, we’ll show you some Azure tools and patterns that will increase your data team’s productivity almost immediately.

  * Some thought processes that are changing:
    * one corporate data lake vs multiple data lakes
    * data lake sandboxes (dev data lakes)
